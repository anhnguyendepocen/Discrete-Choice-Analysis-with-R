## Choices, choices, choices {-}

We are what we choose or we choose what we are. The choices we make have important implications for how we interact with the world. We live in a time when resources continue to become increasingly scarce. In this context, the way people make choices is informative about their preferences and where collectively we are going. This includes routine activities, such as deciding how to travel for everyday purposes, for instance walking or cycling, driving, or using transit. Or longer term decision, such as whether to contract more expensive but environmentally less damaging low impact energy sources; buy hybrid, electric, or gasoline vehicles; the frequency with which they travel by plane; to live in a distant suburb where rent is low, or in a central city where space is at a premium; and many others.

Understanding decision-making is also important so that the world, or more accurately the social institutions that collectively represent us in our interactions with the world, can better accommodate and possibly even nudge our preferences towards socially desirable outcomes. What tradeoffs are members of the public willing to contemplate when choosing alternative mobility? Is it the range of vehicles? Their price? The time it takes to charge an electric vehicle? The satisfaction of being green? Should governments subdidize purchases of efficient heating? If so, what is the effect of a certain amount in subsidy? Do consumers prefer more range in electric vehicles, and how much are they willing to pay for it? Does the tradoff justify the increase in production cost?

These questions are important as governments and businesses try to understand the way the public will respond to taxation, programs, engineering, or production decisions.

In simple terms, discrete choice analysis is a way to understand behavior when there are implicit markets, and in this way it represents a form of hedonic price analysis. 

What are prices? In very general terms a price is a quantity offered in payment for one unit of a good or service. Early economies were based on bartering, a system of exchange that is limited use in even moderately complex economic systems. For instance, imagine a moderately sophisticated economy where people already have ceased being generalists to become specialists of some sort. Someone who spends time making shoes probably has limited time to tend chickens or understand the law of the land.

Imagine that you make and sell shoes. People need shoes and may be willing to offer some quantity of something in exchange for them. The person who breeds chicken maybe willing to offer one chicken for a pair of shoes. Is that a fair price? How can you determine whether that exchange is sensible?

Imagine now that you need a divorce, and a lawyer's services are required for this. How many shoes should you offer the lawyer for a divorce? And what if the lawyer already has shoes?? Maybe the lawyer would prefer to be paid in chickens...

The situation is further complicated by the reliance of bartering on some kind of trust system: as a seller, in a bartering system, there are no simple ways of ensuring the quality of the exchange! For instance, what if the lawyer is a crook, or the farmer gives you diseased chickens for your top-notch, high-quality shoes? In small systems, where agents can recognize each other, trust is enforced by reputation - if the lawyer is crooked, or the farmer is known to feed lead to the poultry, other actors can avoid transactions with them. If your shoes fall apart in the first rain, people will begin to avoid doing business with you!

As these simple examples illustrate, bartering is a complicated way of setting prices, and this becomes increasingly complex (except in very exceptional situations) when an economy produces hundreds, thousands, or even more different products and services.

(An interesting exception is the time when Pepsico bartered with the Soviet Union; [see this news item from 1990](https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/09/business/international-report-pepsi-will-be-bartered-for-ships-vodka-deal-with-soviets.html). In this case, Pepsi-Cola was bartered for ships and vodka. Why did barter make sense in this situation? Hint: the ruble was not freely traded on world currency markets.)

Far from being the root of all evil, it is almost certain that no complex economy can exist without the invention of money. The complexities of bartering explain why monetary systems were invented: the need for a common standard for exchange. Instead of needing to figure out how many shoes is worth a chicken and how many chickens a divorce, everything is measured using the same metric: shells, squares of deer skin, rupees, pesos, or dollars.

## Price Mechanisms

The limitations of bartering explain the necessity of monetary systems. A common currency frees the maker of shoes from the need to calculate in chickens the cost of his divorce. But it does not explain how prices are set in the common currency.

Price mechanisms depend to a large extent of the institutional framework. Several such frameworks exist.

For example, in a centrally planned economy, prices for goods or services are set by a designated agent. This could be the Elder of the Village. The Elder of the village decides how many rupees people should pay for your shoes (alternatively, how much you can charge for a pair of shoes), and how much you should pay a lawyer for each hour of work. Everyone in this kind of setup prays that the Elder of the Village knows what he is doing, and the potential for mistakes clearly is far from negligible. In the Soviet Union prices were set using so called _material balances_, balancing the inputs to the planned outputs. This approach was not successful for several reasons, including ideological limitations to the mathematical tools used to calculate balances, and the inherent limitations of such planning, which does not allow for deviations from the plan (what if you end up needing _two_ divorces instead of only one or none?).

In a free market economy, on the other hand, prices are left to float with no intervention from central planning agencies. There are voluminous literature explaining how this system can allocate resources efficiently. Prices, in this context, are signals of how desirable a good or service is, and how much of it is available. 

Economists explain this relationship using a relationship between demand and supply. 

The basic assumption (which happens to hold in many cases) is that the level of demand for a good or service (the quantity that consumers are willing to purchase) declines as the price increases. On the side of producers/providers of goods and services, the level of supply (the quantity that they are willing to produce) increases with price. Demand and supply, then, are influenced by price, but they do not happen in isolation - rather, they interact to set prices. A consumer cannot single-handedly demand that a good/service be sold at a certain (i.e., low) price when many consumers are willing to pay a somewhat higher price for the same (otherwise I would have bought my Nintendo Switch at 50 dollars). Likewise, a producer/provider cannot expect to set a high price for a good/service when other producers are willing to sell at a lower price. (There are aberrant situations, of course. Monopolies and cartels can manipulate prices on behalf of producers, whereas single-payer health care manipulates prices in favor of patients.)

The intersection of the supply and demand curves determines simultaneously prices _and_ the quantity of a good/service produced/consumed. Since prices "float", they can adjust to changes in supply and/or demand. In Figure 1, for example, when demand for a good or service (say divorces) increases, there is an incentive for lawyers to work more hours. Since there is a limited number of hours that lawyers can work (there is scarcity), this is reflected in a higher price, since those who can afford it will be willing to pay more for a scarce but desirable service.

A third system is a mixed economy, where prices are left to float but within limits or with other corrective mechanisms, such as subsidies or taxes.

The most familiar situation for most of us is price mechanisms in free or mixed economies. An underlying assumption is that a market exists for the good or service, that is, a medium where goods or services can be exchanged. Markets exist for many things: for milk, for bread, for insurance, and for complex financial instruments that no one really understands, such as derivatives. Markets do not explicitly exist for composite products or services, and therefore the willingnes to pay of consumers for _elements_ of a specific good.

Imagine, for instance, a good such as an automobile. Automobiles are composite goods in the sense that, even if their purpose is to provide transportation, they can do this in many different ways to satisfy a diversity of needs or tastes: with variations in leg room, acceleration, and fuel consumption, to name a few. Pricing mechanisms for the whole leave the question of willingness to pay for specific components in the dark. Are consumers willing to pay more or less for extra leg room, more spacious seats, or horsepower? The markets for each of these items are implicit in the market for automobiles.

In fact, hedonic price analysis analysis was invented by an economist named [Andrew Court](http://www.econ.wayne.edu/agoodman/research/pubs/Deep/Court-JUE.pdf) to address such an issue. Court was an economist for the Automobile Manufacturers' Association in Detroit from 1930 to 1940. He realized that price indexing procedures were not satisfactory for describing the relative importance of various components of automobiles in determining their price. This in turn was important to understand consumer preferences and to differentiate products.

Court used the term "hedonic" to express the usefulness and desirability (related to pleasure) that consumers attach to different aspects of a composite product. Although he invented his method in the late 1930s, it lay dormant for approximately twenty years until it was popularized by [Zvi Griliches](https://www.nber.org/chapters/c5976.pdf) in the 1960s, with work on fertilizers and automobiles. Later on, [Sherwin Rosen](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/260169) explained implicit markets within an economic foundation of supply and demand in equilibrium - that is, not just as willingness to pay on the side of consumers, but also as the result of decisions by producers. In brief, Rosen explained how the differentiated hedonic price function represents the envelope of a family of "value" functions (willingness to pay) and a family of offer functions (willingess to sell).

Since then, many uses have been found for hedonic price analysis, with applications ranging from the pricing of [computers](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.2.268), [personal digital assistants](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00036840600993924), and [wine](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09571269908718165) to [online purchases](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.48.4.534) and [farmland](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1744-7976.2006.00053.x). 

The field of discrete choice analysis is concerned with the analysis of implicit markets when the outcome of the choice process is discrete. This requires a few things:

DESCRIBE THE CONDITIONS FOR A PROCESS TO BE A CHOICE.

## Plan {-}

The plan with these notes is to introduce discrete choice analysis in an intuitive way. To achieve this, I use examples and coding, lots of coding. There are some classical references, for instance Ben-Akiva and Lerman [-@Benakiva1985discrete] and Train [-@Train2009discrete], and then more specialized books such as Louviere et al. [-@Louviere2000stated]. Other books cover discrete choice analysis as one component of modelling systems [such as transportation; see @Ortuzar2011modelling], or cover related topics but from a statistical perspective [@Maddala1983limited]. The present notes should be appealing to students or others who are approaching this topic for the first time, I strongly encourage readers to become acquainted with these books if they have not already. 

Each author organizes topics in a way that is logical to them. Some texts begin with a coverage of fundamental mathematics, probability, and statistics. Others with an introduction to a substantive topic (e.g., the context of travel demand analysis). In the book _Applied Choice Analysis: A Primer_ by Hensher et al. [-@hensher2005applied], the title of Chapter 10 is "Getting Started Modeling". Train [-@Train2009discrete], in contrast, begins by discussing the properties of discrete choice models and discussing the logit model right away. 

For presentation I have in the past relied heavily on Train's book to organize my graduate seminar. I find this style of presentation sufficiently intuitive, when combined with some relevant topics introduced at key points. For example, I find that it makes sense to have a discussion of specification and estimation of models after introducing the logit model. In this way, the details of specifying utility functions can be presented in the context of an operational model. Readers will notice that this notes tend to follow Train closely, using a thematic approach, moving from the fundamentals, introducing the logit model, and then by families of models, i.e., GEV, probit, and so on.

Beginning early in the text, readers are asked to get their hands dirty with code. This is a very deliberate decision. Most books on discrete choice analysis are software-independent, meaning that they cover the topics without making reference to a particular statistical package for analysis. Others rely for presentation on a specific software. For instance, Hensher et al. [-@hensher2005applied] refer extensively to the software `NLOGIT`, a software package sold by [Econometric Software, Inc.](http://www.limdep.com/). Yet other packages were originally developed independently of a statistical computing project. One example is Michel Bierlaire's [BIOGEME](http://biogeme.epfl.ch/). Not being associated with a statistical computing project means that synergies with other packages cannot be realized. Newer versions of BIOGEME now exist written almost exclusively in Python and that allow the package to benefit from the Python Data Analysis Library [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

For this text, I have chosen `R`. `R` is a generalist statistical language with a very broad user base. I personally find `R` more accessible than Python, for example, as an introduction to statistical and data analysis computing, particularly with the support of a good Interactive Development Environment such as [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). 

Packages (the fundamental units of shareable code in `R`) benefit from the synergyes of many developers and users sharing their code in a transparent and open way. Ten years ago it would have been very difficult to write a book on discrete choice modelling based on `R`: the earliest version of Croissant's `mlogit` package [@Croissant2019mlogit] dates from 2009; the earliest version of Sarrias and Daziano's `gmnl` package [@Sarrias2017multinomial] dates from 2015. Secondly, `R` and related packages are free. It is my conviction that research can be accelerated by the generous contributions of developers who graciously share their code with the world. By doing this, they help to maintain the cost of research low, and thus enable more people around the world to engage in it. That said, there is a potential disadvantage: unlike more established (especially commercial) packages that have been kicking around for years if not decades, newer `R` packages may still have some limitations. To mention one, the current versions of the packages `mlogit` and `gmnl` are implemented exclusively for universal choice set, in other words, under the assumption that all alternatives are available to all decision-makers. There are situations, For example, suppose 

My plan for this text, therefore, is to cover a topic in each section that builds on previous material. I have used the materials presented in these notes (in different incarnations) for teaching discrete choice analysis in different settings. Primarily, these notes have been used in the course **GEOG 738** _Discrete Choice Analysis_ at McMaster University. This course is a full (Canadian) graduate term, which typically means 11 or 12 weeks of classes. The course is organized as a 2-hour seminar that is offered once per week. Accordingly, each section is designed to cover very approximately the material that I am used to cover in a 2 hour seminar.

As I continue to work on these notes, I hope to be able to add optional (or bonus) chapters, that could be used 1) to extend a course on discrete choice analysis beyond the 12 week horizon of the Canadian graduate school term, and/or 2) to offer more advanced material to interested readers.

## Audience {-}

The notes were designed for a graduate course in geography, but are not necessarily limited to geographers, and could indeed be a valuable resource to graduate students and others interested in discrete choice analysis and applications in economics, planning, transportation engineering, public health, etc. The prerequisites are an introductory college/university level course on multivariate statistics, ideally covering the fundamentals of probability theory and hypothesis testing. Working knowledge of multivariate linear regression analysis is a bonus but not strictly required.

## Requisites {-}

This book is not a course to learn `R`. The language is introduced progressively, and assumes that readers are computer-literate and have possible done some basic coding in the past. For readers who wish to learn `R` there are other sources such as Wickham and Grolemund [-@wickham2016r](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) or Albert and Rizzo [@Albert2012r].

To fully benefit from this text, up-to-date copies of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) are highly recommended. There are different packages that implement discrete choice methods in `R`. I will particularly rely on the packages [`mlogit`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mlogit) and [`gmnl`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gmnl).
